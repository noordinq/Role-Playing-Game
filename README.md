This is a role-play game that is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a basic game containing simple code that can be used as a starter.
The game itself is based on a user fighting beasts i.e The Dragon, A Slime and a  Fanged Beast.
It contains three buttons that provide different functionality i.e A store button, a cave button and the dragon button.
The store button enables the user to either buy health or a weapon, but this depends on the gold availability of the user.
The cave button presents another setting where the user is able to fight the slime and the fanged beast.
In Addition, there is an easter egg provided where the user can get to play another 'options game' within it. All in all, a simple and fun experience!
